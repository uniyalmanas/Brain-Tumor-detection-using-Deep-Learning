# Brain-Tumor-detection-using-Deep-Learning
This project describes how to use deep learning (CNN) to detect brain tumor in medical images, solving the problem of tumor differentiation and unraveling the complexity of the distributed grid. Four prominent CNN architectures and two additional models (MobileNet) are assessed for their performance in brain tumor classification. The research employs a varied dataset of brain MRI scans, incorporating different tumor types, sizes, and locations. Pre-processing techniques, such as image normalization and augmentation, enhance model robustness. Each CNN is fine-tuned and trained, with experiments evaluating accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and computational efficiency. The comparative analysis identifies strengths and weaknesses, providing insights into the models' suitability for real-world clinical applications.
